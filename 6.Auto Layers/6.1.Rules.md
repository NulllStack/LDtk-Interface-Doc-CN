### Editing a rule

**Rules are grid patterns that will decide if a specific tile should be painted on your layer.**

To open the rule editor:

### Grass

Here is a simple rule:

It says *“Paint the tile if” :*

1. in any given cell, **there is** a “*walls*” IntGrid value (white)
2. AND **there is no** “*walls*” value above.

### Dirt

And here is another one:

This second one means: “*Paint the tile if any given grid cell contains a “walls” value*“.
